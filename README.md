# 🐇 Hop n' Hook

*Hop n' Hook* is a 2D side-scrolling adventure where you play as a flannel-wearing rabbit who’s just as handy with a fishing rod as they are with their hops. Use your fishing rod not only to catch fish, but also to launch, swing, and grapple your way through the wild.

### 🧗‍♂️ Movement & Grappling Rod

Your rabbit's platforming abilities include:
